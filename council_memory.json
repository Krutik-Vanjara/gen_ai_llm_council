    "final_answer": "**FINAL ANSWER:**\n\nAn algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions or rules used to solve a problem or accomplish a specific task. It consists of:\n\n* **Clear Steps:** A structured sequence of actions that are unambiguous for others (and the computer) to follow.\n* **Precise Instructions:** Each step in the process has explicit definitions on what inputs and outputs are involved.\n* **Input & Output:** The algorithm has defined starting points (\"inputs\") and desired end results (\"outputs\").\n* **Logic:** Algorithms rely heavily on logic to ensure accurate outcomes.\n\nThis definition accurately captures the essence of an algorithm, emphasizing its role as a blueprint for solving complex problems using computers."

    "final_answer": "**FINAL ANSWER:**\n\nWhat is 2+2? The answer is **4**.\n\nHowever, it's also worth noting that this question doesn't require an algorithm, as it's a simple arithmetic operation that can be solved without any complex rules or instructions. An algorithm is typically used to solve more complex problems or perform specific tasks, whereas basic arithmetic operations like 2+2 are straightforward and don't necessitate the use of an algorithm.\n\nDefinition:\nAn algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions or rules used to solve a problem or accomplish a specific task. It consists of:\n\n* **Clear Steps:** A structured sequence of actions designed to achieve a particular goal.\n* **Well-Defined Rules:** A set of rules that govern the algorithm's behavior and ensure consistency.\n* **Input/Output:** The algorithm takes input data, processes it, and produces output.\n\nIn contrast, basic arithmetic operations like 2+2 are not algorithms because they don't require a structured sequence of actions or well-defined rules to solve. They can be solved using simple mental math or calculators, making them more akin to fundamental mathematical concepts rather than algorithmic processes."
